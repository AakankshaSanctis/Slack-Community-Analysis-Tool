# How to contribute

Thank you for contributing to Slack Community Analysis Tool (SCAT)!  This document provides a brief set of guidelines for contributing.

# Background

SCAT currently uses a "fork and pull" model for collaborative software development.

From the [GitHub Help Page of Using Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/):

"The fork & pull model lets anyone fork an existing repository and push changes to their personal fork without requiring access be granted to the source repository. The changes must then be pulled into the source repository by the project maintainer. This model reduces the amount of friction for new contributors and is popular with open source projects because it allows people to work independently without upfront coordination."

## Branches within SCAT

SCAT currently maintains two branche(s):
 * **master**:  this is the stable branch to be used for installation.
 * **dev**: all of the development happens on dev and is periodically merged with master
 * **rohan**: rohangoel96's personal branch - can be ignored

## Automated tests on Travis CI
All Pull Requests are automatically tested on [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/).
